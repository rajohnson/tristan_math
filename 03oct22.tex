\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=\fill]
    \item  Drane and Route Plumbing Co. charges \$42 per hour, plus \$35 for a service call. Let $x$ be the number of hours that they work. The expression describing the cost in dollars of work taking $x$ hours is given by:
    \[ 42x+35 \]
    \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=\fill]
        \item To find how long work that costs \$56 would take, set the expression for the cost equal to the value of interest and solve. Can you finish this?
            \[ 42x+35=56 \]\\
        \item How would you set up an equation to solve for how long \$1000 of work would take. Just set it up, don't solve.
\vfill\clearpage
        \item Set up an equation to find how long \$140 of work would take. Then solve it.
        \item How much would 3 hours of work cost?
